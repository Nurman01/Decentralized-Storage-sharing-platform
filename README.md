Objective:
To create a decentralized platform where users can rent out unused storage space on their
devices and others can use it to store their files securely and affordably.
Motivation:
● Reduce costs associated with centralized cloud storage services.
● Promote resource sharing by utilizing underutilized storage space.
● Provide a decentralized, secure, and censorship-resistant storage option.
Core Features:
1. File Encryption and Fragmentation: Files are encrypted, fragmented, and stored
across multiple nodes for security and redundancy.
Additional Features:
1. Automated Backup & Redundancy: Ensures that files are replicated across
multiple locations, providing fault tolerance and data recovery.
2. Version Control: Tracks and manages different versions of files for easy access and
recovery.
Detailed Architecture:
1. User Application:
○ Storage Providers: Register available space for rent.
○ Storage Consumers: Upload and manage files.
○ Dashboard: For tracking usage, payments, and performance.
2. Blockchain Layer:
○ Smart Contracts: Automate storage rental agreements, payment, and data
retrieval.
○ File Distribution Contracts: Manage the splitting and distribution of file
fragments across multiple providers.
3. Storage Network(optional):
○ Distributed Nodes: Store encrypted file fragments across different nodes.
○ File Recovery Mechanism: Ensures users can retrieve data even if some
nodes fail.
4. Token System:
○ Storage Tokens: Used for payments between storage providers and
consumers.
○ Incentives(optional): Reward providers for maintaining uptime and
performance.
